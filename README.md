<h1># Unlock-Smartphone-PIN</h1>
<h4>this my simple python project to unlock smartphone pin with adb</h4>
<p>
====================
   how to use it 
==================== <br>
1. extract adb.zip (here I use windows)<br>
2. Move the run.py & wordlist.txt files into the platform-tools folder<br>
3. connect the smartphone to the laptop with a usb cable and enable usb debugging(turn on dev mode), permit all access <br>
4. Run the run.py file<br>
<br></p>

<br><p> btw it's an adb file for windows, so if you want to successfully run this tool, find adb suitable for your operating system </br></p>
